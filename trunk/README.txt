=====================================
twistedae - Twisted Google App Engine
=====================================

The twistedae project aims at providing a full-featured and productive stack to
run Google App Engine applications. It delivers the parts for building your own
scalable App Engine while staying compatible with Google's API.


The Stack
---------

The default configuration is built upon following services::

  * mongoDB
  * memcached
  * nginx
  * FastCGI
  * supervisor

Running the cloud out of the box
--------------------------------

Build and the whole stack by typing the following commands::

  $ python bootstrap.py
  $ ./bin/buildout

Configure the demo application::

  $ ./bin/apptool parts/demo/

Run the supervisor daemon, which starts and controls all services at once::

  $ ./bin/supervisord

You can access the application using a web browser with the following URL::

  http://localhost:8080/


Google's development application server
---------------------------------------

You may recognize the dev_appserver script in the bin directory after building
the environment. It's included to check whether your application runs with the
installed original SDK.

It can be used as expected::

  $ bin/dev_appserver parts/demo


Testing
-------

Run unit tests by typing (running supervisord required)::

  $ bin/nosetests
