= Before you install =

== Google App Engine SDK ==

You don't have to install the Google App Engine SDK, because [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout zc.buildout] will install it for you. Only the Python interpreter is needed. See http://code.google.com/intl/de/appengine/docs/python/overview.html which Python version is supported by the Google App Engine SDK.

It is advisable to install twistedae into a [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv virtualenv] in order to obtain isolation from any “system” packages you’ve got installed in your Python version.

== Other requirements ==

For building the NGINX HTTP server the [http://www.pcre.org PCRE library] is required.
