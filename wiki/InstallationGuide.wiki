= Before you install =

You don't have to install the Google App Engine distribution, because [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout zc.buildout] will install it for you. Only the Python interpreter is needed. See http://code.google.com/intl/de/appengine/docs/python/overview.html which Python version is supported by the Google App Engine SDK.

It is advisable to install twistedae into a [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv virtualenv] in order to obtain isolation from any “system” packages you’ve got installed in your Python version.

= Installation =

 * Check out the sources:
  {{{
  $ svn checkout http://twistedae.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ twistedae
  }}}

 * Build the stack:
  {{{
  $ python bootstrap.py
  $ ./bin/buildout

 * Let the cloud fly:
  {{{
  $ mkdir -p var/log
  $ ./bin/supervisord
  }}}

 * Access the application using a web browser with the following URL: http://localhost:8080/
